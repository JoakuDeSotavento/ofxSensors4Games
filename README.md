Introduction
------------

This addon provides a interface to control games by sending detected actions to external games by OSC / UPD.
Infrared cameras are the most cheap to use. But There are other powerfull sensors that can be also used. 
For now I keep the posibility external sensors by OSC protocol sending kind of blob data. 

Internal Sensors allowed: Camera and Videoplayer for testing. Kinect ( require specific installation ).
External sensors tested are: RadarGlxRss3 and LaserRange Sick LMS1XX. 

This addon is using the last v0.9.8 release but should work with others 0.9.x Of versions.


Installation
------------

Copy the `ofxSensors4Games` folder into your `openFrameworks/addons/` folder.
Use included Examples for testing: In ofApp.cpp at setup choose your sensor / simulation mode.

	
Dependencies
------------
Externals:
* ofxImgui (https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxImGui)

Internals:
* ofxNetwork
* ofxOsc
* ofxOpencv
* ofxKinect add this manually. !!! README  !!! ofxkinect README (usb libs install) 


Compatibility
------------

Tested with OF 0.9.x on

    Mac OS 10.11, Xcode 7 (WIP)
    Windows 7, QTcreator (WIP)
    Windows 7/10, Visual Studio 2015

For dedicated camera uses. It's important to have full control of sensor: 
 - For webcam cameras: Auto White Balance and Auto Exposition are required to allow a precise camera control.


Usage
-----

myControllerOscServer sends different desired and selected data

//ResumedBlob
osc:/GameBlob
*	- (float) x pos 	[0..1]
*	- (float) y pos 	[0..1]
*	- (float) UP mov 	[0..1]
*	- (float) DOWN mov	[0..1]
* (TODO)	- (int) Poligon Points	[0..1] //For now just 4 ( Quad )
* (TODO)	- (float) Quad Area x0	[0..1]
* (TODO)	- (float) Quad Area x1	[0..1]
* (TODO)	- (float) Quad Area x2	[0..1]
* (TODO)	- (float) Quad Area x3	[0..1]

//Tracking Blobs (WIP)
osc:/TrackingBlobs
*	- (int) id
*	- (float) pos
*	- (float) vel
*	- (int) detected action
* (TODO)	- (int) Poligon Points	[0..1] //For now just 4 ( Quad )
* (TODO)	- (float) Quad Area x0	[0..1]
* (TODO)	- (float) Quad Area x1	[0..1]
